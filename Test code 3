Q3.
3. Write program to find first n Disarium numbers and Disarium numbers between two given numbers.

A number is said to be Disarium if it is equal to sum of its digits raised to the power of their respective position in the number. 
For example, 135 is a Disarium number. Because, it is equal to sum of its digits raised to the power of their respective position.

135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3
135 = 1 + 9 + 125




input=[135]
total = sum(int(digit) ** (i + 1) for i, digit in (str(num)))
if total == num:
    print(f"{num} is a Disarium number!")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a Disarium number.")
