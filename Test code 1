#Q1.
There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it.
A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will
tell his two neighbors left and right side.
What is the maximum stolen value?


def maxsteal(val):
    def helper(n):
        if n <= 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return val[0]
        return max(val[n-1] + helper(n-2), helper(n-1))
    return helper(len(val))
val = [6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 5]
print(maxsteal(val))
Output: 20
